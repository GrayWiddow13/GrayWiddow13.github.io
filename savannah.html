            <p>I'm sorry for kinda brushing you off this morning. I mean I do try my best to appreciate you every day but you deserve a day to feel special though. I really do appreciate you so much and you deserve to know that too. I remember on our first
                “date” (which was really a date because of Collin and Claire and all that but anyway) how I was so excited because when I first saw you you were so gorgeous and I just felt so lucky and special to have someone like you even think of going
                on a date with me. I also remember sitting down at the table at that Mexican restaurant thinking about how nice you seemed even though I've only really known you for a small bit. I was so excited after that about how we were going to hang
                out for the afternoon activities and how you didn't want to get rid of me right away and how you wanted to spend even more time with me. I was so excited and that's what made me “lose” my wallet. I was just so excited to be able to see
                you again even though I only saw you like an hour ago. I still do that every single time I leave to go see you. I have to stop myself at the door and go through my mental list of everything I should have like 10x just to make sure. But
                I remember going to bed that night feeling so lucky to not only have been with a girl as gorgeous as you but also as funny and kind (but not too kind
                <3) and smart as you. I never expected it to last as long as it has but I 'm so glad that it has. </p>
                
            <br><p>For our second “date” which still wasn't really as much of a date as I would
                    've liked it to be, I remember my mom telling me about how I could bring a friend along because I would be bored just being by myself or with Harry on the bunny hill. I was so scared to ask her about bringing you. I also remember saying you were just a friend even though we had been calling every night since YIG getting closer and closer. I had to endure the whole embarrassing car ride with my mom AND BROTHER in the car. I almost killed myself just from that. But once I was able to split from my family and just be with you things got better. I remember trying to hold your hand as you were going down the bunny hill because you were afraid of falling in front of me. I still find the “not a hat person” thing funny to this day. I was looking through the photos of that day earlier today and It just brought back how happy I was to see you and how happy I am every time I see you. After skiing, I was excited that my mom allowed you to stay with us for after dinner and I was so nervous about what I was going to do at that time but I don't really know why. Eventually, we ended up kissing and something about it just told me that you were the one. I don
                    't think it was the attraction to you or the adrenaline of the time that told me that. But something inside me let me know that you definitely were the one. I felt so warm inside and it made me feel something I've never felt before. I knew ever since then that I was as in love with you as any person could ever be.</p>


                    <br>
                    <p>After that, I had to wait a little more than a month to see you again. The waiting was so hard for me but I got through it. During that time my mom started becoming more and more suspicious of us because of our constant calling but
                        honestly, I think she always knew. I knew how much I wanted to see you again but schedules would never line up and no one wanted to drive the distance even though now looking back on it, the drive honestly isn't that bad. Sure
                        it can be boring at times but it isn't too awful. But back on topic, we met up again in late February at your house. I remember how much we kissed that day. I don't know but you just looked so gorgeous and I have been looking forward
                        to being with you again for so long. I got to know you so much better in between that time and the more and more I got to know you the more and more I fell in love with you (And it's still like that to this day
                        <3). My brain is very hazy of what happened that day exactly though. My brain was going so fast and I just felt so in love with you even though we still haven 't known each other for that long. Now that I look back on it I'm 99% sure we did some things
                            that weren 't 100% PG too. But the one thing I do remember well was finally being able to ask you to be my girlfriend. I had waited for so long for it and it was so relieving finally ask you. I specifically remember the big giant hug that ensued with its following and just as big a kiss. I also remember some little things that happened after that but before the next time, we saw each other. I weirdly remember you doing a coloring book on call and looking super beautiful. I was in awe that whole call just from your beauty. And I also remember when you got drunk and whenever I asked how much you drank you kept on changing the amount that you said. Sometimes it would get bigger and sometimes it would get smaller but all I knew was that by the end of the night, that bottle was empty. You were kinda horny that night too but not coherent enough to actually do anything. I remember you awkwardly taking your bra off and throwing it across the room just to cover yourself up with a blanket for the rest of the night and then eventually going to bed. </p>

            <br><p>The next time we met up though was when I first gave you my sweatshirt. We were at your dad's house and I was so excited to meet Bebe and Cheese. You were so stunning that day too. You were so nice to me too. We ended up watching
                            Alice in Wonderland too. You made me the whole Valentine
                            's Day basket too and I remember going home and crying before going on call with you that night because you were so nice to me. Everything in the basket was so nice and thoughtful and I loved it so so so so much. You never did really have to do anything like that but you still did and that makes you all the much better.  I also remember I ended up fingering you that day somehow and that sometime that night you ranted for a little bit about how hot it was and how much you liked it and I was so relieved because I honestly had zero clue what I was doing and if you couldn't tell I still have zero clue. But I try my best because it makes you happy and that 's all that matters to me. It makes me feel closer to you as a person and that's all that I want to be; close to you, sexual or not. You bring
                            so much happiness into my life and I hope I do the same for you. </p>


                            <br>
                            <p>After that was your birthday party and that was so much fun because you seemed annoyed but joyed at the same time because I was there. It was fun meeting some of your family but it was so scary honestly. I was scared out of
                                my mind and it was so awkward. Either way, I tried my best to make your birthday the best for you because you deserve exactly that and even more. I still fuck heavy with your younger aunt. I only saw her for like 5 mins
                                but the vibes were crazy bro and I don't normally do that whole vibe shit. After that, it took 2 more weeks to see you again and we still did get a little R-rated but honestly I remember the most just having you lay in
                                my arms and thinking about how lucky I was. You took a photo on my phone of that moment when I was spaced out thinking about you. That time was at my house again and I was so scared to get it clean for you and comfy (which
                                it clearly wasn't because you had to buy me a blanket lol). But I was so worried to get it perfect for my princess. Either way, I was so excited to show you my stuff. My brain is starting to explode. I'm not the fastest
                                writer but I'm trying my best for you. My dad just got me dinner and I think I'm going to finish this quick before I eat it. </p>


                            <br>
                            <p>Overall babe, every single moment no matter how big or small I appreciate so very much and look back on it dearly. I truly believe you are the one meant for me. I love you so very very very much and I hope you think the same
                                of me. You really are the most beautiful person (inside and out) and I cannot thank you enough for just being who you are and giving me a chance one random day during YIG while you still technically did have a boyfriend.
                                You mean the world to me and I cannot stress it enough. Thank you so much for everything you've done for me during the time we've been together. I really cannot wait soon enough to see what we turn into in the future because
                                I just know we are going to go somewhere special. Eres el amor de mi vida y no elegiría pasar estos 7 meses con nadie más que contigo. I just want to tell you how much I love you. Thank you, Savannah
                                <3 </p>
